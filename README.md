As a matter of interest and passion for JavaScript and music in general, I created a ReactJS web application for my band UPPERCASE.

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vite), and tested with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/guide/).

The live site can be found on:  

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
